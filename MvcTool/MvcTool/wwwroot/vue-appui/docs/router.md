# Router

Routing system is based on [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) so
to get more information about it please read its official documentation
at [https://router.vuejs.org](https://router.vuejs.org).

## Application Routes

Application routes are defined in `src/router/routes.js` and exist as `<router-link>` elements in `src/App.vue`.

To add / edit route, you should make changes in `src/router/routes.js` and `src/App.vue` accordingly.
